# Module 10 Challenge

SQLAlchemy Challenge

Assignment Submission by: Lena Thongdara

In this task, we used Python and SQLAlchemy to study and show climate data from a SQLite database. We also created a Flask API to make it easy for users to access the data analysis. The API offers different routes, allowing users to get information like precipitation, stations, and temperature data based on their requests.
